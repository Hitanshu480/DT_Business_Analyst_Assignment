# DT_Business_Analyst_Assignment
This repository contains my submission for the DT Business Analyst Role Test Drive Assignment.

Task 1:
Design of a daily clinic inventory micro-audit system to detect sales-entry errors and prevent inventory mismatches.

Task 2:
Design of a patient care and communication control system using HMS data and Google Sheets logic to reduce doctor workload and communication chaos.

All systems are designed to be simple, practical, and runnable in a real clinic environment.
